# CG-Geometric-Spanners-inside-Polygon
This repository was created for the Computational Geometry course project.
We are gonna implement an algorithm to compute **the geometric spanners for points inside a polygonal domain**.
This project uses **Typescript** for the core implementation and JavaScript's **p5.js** library for visualization and interactive environment.

## Setup Instructions
1) Install node.js version v22.21.0 (LTS) using nvm with npm package manager:
   * https://nodejs.org/en/download
   * For Windows you can use Chocolatey or install using a Windows Installer (.msi)
2) Install TypeScript using npm in the project's home directory
   * ```npm install typescript --save-dev```
   * https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/
3) Compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript using the following:
   * ```npx tsc```

## Project Structure
TypeScript code is found within the src/ directory.  
It will compiled to the dist/ directory.
