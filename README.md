# CG-Geometric-Spanners-inside-Polygon
This repository was created for the Computational Geometry course project.
We are gonna implement an algorithm to compute **the geometric spanners for points inside a polygonal domain**.
This project uses **Typescript** for the core implementation and JavaScript's **p5.js** library for visualization and interactive environment.

## how to use
Normally, you need to write the code in sketch.ts or any file in src/Name.ts
After writing the code with the command *-npx tsc*, it would be compiled into a .js file.

**You need to install the compiler if it is not already installed, using the command

*-npm install --save-dev typescript @types/p5*
