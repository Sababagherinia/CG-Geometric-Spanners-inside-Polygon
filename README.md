# CG-Geometric-Spanners-inside-Polygon
This repository was created for the Computational Geometry course project.
We are gonna implement an algorithm to compute **the geometric spanners for points inside a polygonal domain**.
This project uses **Typescript** for the core implementation and JavaScript's **p5.js** library for visualization and interactive environment.
